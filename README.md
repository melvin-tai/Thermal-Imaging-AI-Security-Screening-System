### Thermal-Imaging-A.I.-Security-Screening-System

    Estimated Project Start: October 2025

Project Aim: An AI-powered thermal imaging computer vision security screening system trained on a specialized dataset to detect threats in real time and achieve high-precision classification to exact labeling (e.g. "Glock-19", "Blade, 5-inch").

Project Vision: To reduce the use of x-ray, time, and money resources when undergoing basic security screening.
